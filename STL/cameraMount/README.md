# cameraMount
The cameraMount accessory is meant for attaching either a GoPro or a mobile phone to your deck. Items like [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IQ7PRHU/) which can then screw into [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01L3B5PBI/) make it very easy to attack a phone.

The lateral screw is designed to be a 25mm M5.
